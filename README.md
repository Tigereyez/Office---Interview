 Test 1 VR Game.
 I used teleportation because from my understanding there is only one button available to the player in cardboard VR and that one is reserved for opening the tap door.
 It also helps with motion sickness which is better for people who are new to VR.
 The 2 doors on the right have an event trigger that makes them change color as the player looks at them and taps on them but only one opens when doing this.
 Animations are done with the unity animator.
 The closed door doesn't have this because it would overide the red when in proximity and looking at the door.
 The telepoting pads also have this event trigger but only when looking at it.
 I didin't try the extra task as i have no experience in making in-game menus that the player can use to switch game objects.
